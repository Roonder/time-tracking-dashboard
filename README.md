### What I learned

In this project I played around a little bit with the different pages that you can do in a single website. Making use of the Fetch to be able to consume the JSON for dynamic data, using promises, functions and the use of a while loop to clean the HTML with the best performance possible.

## Acknowledgments

I want to acknoledge my Udemy teacher, Juan De la Torre, because thanks to his good practices on JavaScript, I was able to improve on my code and my problem solving logic. Even though I have a lot more to learn, this was a really good project that I enjoyed, not only doing it, but also realizing my small progress.
